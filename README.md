# Tokenizer Master Visualizer

The **Tokenizer Master Visualizer** is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the concepts of tokenization and merging in natural language processing (NLP). By visualizing how text is broken down into tokens and how those tokens can be merged, this tool provides an engaging and educational experience for learners of all levels.

## Features

- **Interactive Tokenization**: Input any text and see how it is tokenized into individual characters.
- **Merging Visualization**: Observe how the most frequent adjacent tokens are merged to create new tokens.
- **Dynamic Statistics**: View real-time statistics, including the number of tokens, vocabulary size, and compression ratio.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design with adjustable parameters for a customized experience.
- **Educational Explanations**: Detailed explanations using relatable metaphors to enhance understanding.

## Installation

To run the Tokenizer Master Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokenizer-master-visualizer.git
   cd tokenizer-master-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application, and it should automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Input Text**: Enter any text in the input field to see how it is tokenized.
2. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to reinitialize the tokens based on the new input.
3. **Perform Merge**: Click the "Perform Merge" button to merge the most frequent adjacent tokens.
4. **Auto Play**: Toggle the "Auto Play" feature to automatically perform merges at a specified speed.
5. **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to adjust the speed of the auto-play feature.
6. **View Options**: Switch between different views (Tokens, Merges, Compression) to visualize the data in various formats.

## Explanations

The visualizer provides detailed explanations of the tokenization and merging processes, using relatable metaphors to enhance understanding. For example:
- Tokenization is likened to breaking down a puzzle into its individual pieces.
- Merging tokens is compared to combining popular ingredients in a recipe.
