## Problems solved through Tokenizer 

A tokenizer addresses several key problems in natural language processing (NLP):

1. Text Segmentation
Breaks down text into smaller units (tokens) like words, subwords, or characters, which is essential for text analysis, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER).

2. Normalization
Standardizes text by:
Lowercasing
Removing punctuation
Expanding contractions
3. Multilingual Handling
Adapts to different languages and scripts, ensuring accurate tokenization across diverse texts.

4. Subword Tokenization
Reduces out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and improves model efficiency by breaking rare words into smaller subword units.

5. Text Compression
Uses techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to merge frequent token pairs, resulting in a more compact representation and reducing storage and transmission costs.

6. Preprocessing for Models
Transforms text into numerical tokens and sequences for machine learning models, facilitating text understanding and generation.

Summary
Tokenizers enhance text processing by segmenting, normalizing, and compressing text, handling multiple languages, and preparing data for machine learning models.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Visualizes the initial tokenization of text into individual characters.
- **Merging**: Demonstrates the process of merging the most frequent pairs of adjacent tokens.
- **Compression**: Shows the compression ratio as the number of tokens decreases.
- **Auto Play**: Automatically performs merges at a specified interval.
- **Different Views**: Toggle between views to see tokens, merges, and compression.
